# üîã Low Power DC Energy Meter

A compact Arduino Nano-based 5V DC energy meter designed to measure, display, and log voltage, current, power, and energy consumption in real-time. This project was developed as part of the Logic Circuit Design (ECT 203) course at Amal Jyothi College of Engineering.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

1. **Power Supply**: 9V battery regulated to 5V using 7805.
2. **Measurement**: INA219 reads current and voltage of the load.
3. **Processing**: Arduino Nano calculates:
   - Power = Voltage √ó Current
   - Energy (mWh) over time
4. **Display**: OLED shows real-time values.
5. **Logging**: Data is written to a `.csv` file on a microSD card every second.

## üßæ Code Structure

- `setup()` initializes peripherals, timer, display, and file.
- `loop()` runs every second via timer interrupt:
  - Fetches readings
  - Updates OLED
  - Logs data to `MEAS.csv` on the SD card
